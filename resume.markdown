# Steve Grossi (he/him)

<p class="lede">Full-stack product developer and team lead</p>

## Skills

Empathy, curiosity, and clarity foremost—then Ruby, Rails, Elixir, JavaScript, React, SQL, Docker, and AWS.

## Lead Software Engineer and Engineering Manager at Lessonly <span class="subhead">(November 2014–Present)</span>

- As Lessonly's second engineer, I've helped grow a culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing. With code reviews, shared style guides, automation, and more, I've focused on building more than software—on building systems, practices, and patterns that have helped us scale from two engineers to 30.
- As a Lead Engineer, I've coached teams of developers of various backgrounds and experience levels to question, understand, decompose, deploy, measure, iterate on, and communicate about flagship features of the platform like learning paths, commenting, and a Chrome extension.
- As we've scaled up, I've honed the ability to analyze an optimize code and infrastructure through simplification, optimization, and caching (ideally in that order)
- As an Engineering Manager for several years and enablement lead afterward, I've worked primarily on empowering my team with communities of practice, automation tools that save time and provide context when it's needed, and abstractions like APIs for common needs to containerized dev environments.
- Since 2017, I helped start and run Lessonly's employee-led Diversity & Inclusion group. We organized discussion groups, an executive panel, and community outreach events that measurably improved the diversity of the company.

## Senior Developer at Alldayeveryday <span class="subhead">(January 2013–November 2014)</span>

- Lead developer building a mobile-responsive, international publishing platform for Gap’s global media team.
- Sole developer for Gap’s 2013 online holiday gift guide, an editorialized shopping experience backed by a custom Rails CMS.
- Co-developer of an HTML5 mobile web app for Nike’s Global Media Summit using Rails and Backbone.js. Features included a live calendar, photo stream, and chat.

## Senior Coordinator of Online Projects at Cancer*Care* <span class="subhead">(July 2009–January 2013)</span>

- Migrated cancercare.org from a folder of PHP files to a maintainable, version-controlled web application with a custom CMS built on Rails.
- Designed and built many of Cancer*Care*’s supplemental sites including cancercarecopay.org, cancercareforwomen.org, and myelofibrosisawareness.org.
- Managed two contract developers brought on to help with major projects.

## In the Community

- Since moving to Indianapolis, I’ve been a frequent member and sometime speaker at the Indy.rb Ruby users’ group.
- I organized [Indy Elixir](https://www.indyelixir.org/), the local Elixir users’ group before taking it online-only due to COVID.
- I've volunteered with Railsbridge Indy, teaching Ruby and Rails chiefly to folks underrepresented in the industry.

## New York University <span class="subhead">B.A. in Philosophy & Comparative Literature</span>

Philosophy and literature prepared me unexpectedly well for a career in software. Philosophy taught me how to take apart, construct, and write clearly about complex concepts and systems. And comp-lit taught me how to approach pretty much anything from a variety of useful critical perspectives.
